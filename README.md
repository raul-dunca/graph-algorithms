# üåê Graph Algorithms
## Assignments
- [Assigment 01](https://github.com/raul-dunca/graph-algorithms-assignment1) - implemented an **abstract data type** directed graph and a function for reading a directed graph from a text file.
- [Assigment 02](https://github.com/raul-dunca/graph-algorithms-assignment2) - implemented a function that finds the **connected components** of an **undirected graph** using a **depth-first traversal** of the graph and the **undirected graph abstract data type**.
- [Assigment 03](https://github.com/raul-dunca/graph-algorithms-assignment3) - implemented a function that  finds a **lowest cost walk** of a **directed graph** between the given vertices, or prints a message if there are negative cost cycles accessible from the starting vertex using `Ford's algorithm`.
- [Assigment 04](https://github.com/raul-dunca/graph-algorithms-assignment4) - implemented a function that constructs a **minumal spanning tree** using the `Kruskal's algorithm` of a **undirected connected graph**.
- [Assigment 05](https://github.com/raul-dunca/graph-algorithms-assignment5) - implemented a function that for an **undirected graph**, find a vertex coloring with minimum number of colors.
